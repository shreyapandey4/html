                happy birthday. i was reading up, about how easy it is to archive everything over the internet.
                how this means both things at once: that physical proof of our existence will be hard to locate
                and in a sense, nothing will be retained. but how in another sense, everything will be retained. 
                i dont know enough html/css to make this website pretty, but i love u enough to want to hoard
                a small piece of the internet in order to store my love for you. 
            </p>

                <br>i want you to be happy and i want you to get everything that you want. i want to offer you a piece of the sun.
                i want you to be in my life forever. i want both of us to be happy. <em>I know you </em> is emphasised in that poem
                and that sums up our friendship in three words. you know me. and i know you. i've always thought saying you <em>know</em>
                someone was a bold and ridiculous claim but i've come around now. im coming to see that what your friendship offers has 
                always been <em>more</em> and has always been <em>special</em> in a way the other friendships in my life are not. and will
                never be. please have a great year and take care of yourself. im so proud of the person you're becoming.
